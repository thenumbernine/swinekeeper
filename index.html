		HELP:<br>
		This is just like original minesweeper but with varying detection neighborhoods.<Br>
		<br>
		
		Click to reveal if a tile has a mine or not.<br>
		If it does then you lose.<br>
		If it does not then it will show you a number telling you how many mines are in its neighborhood.<br>
		<br>

		Right-click to place a flag over a mine.<br>
		Mobile users: long-press to place a flag.<br>
		Flagged tiles cannot be clicked (and accidentally detonated).<br>
		<br>

		Hover your mouse over a tile to show a tile's neighborhood of detection.<br>
		In original minesweeper, this neighborhood consisted of just the 3x3 tiles surrounding it.<br>
		in Swinekeeper, the detection neighborhoods vary per tile.<br>
		<br>
		
		In mobile mode, there is no mouse-over, so I provided the "two clicks to reveal..." option.<br>
		With this enabled, the first click on a tile will reveal its neighborhood, and the second click will reveal the tile.<br>
		<br>
		
		<hr>

		You can choose on the right column under 'neighborhoods' which possible neighborhoods to allow.<br>
		If you uncheck all of them except the '3x3' option then you will get original minesweeper.<br>
		<br>
		
		<hr>
		<br>

		Now when you open a tile, it will tell you first the number of mines next to it, and next the letter indicating what kind of neighborhood it is using to detect the mines.<br>
		The 'neighborhoods' legend in the upper-right will show you what each of the letters mean.<br>
		<br>
		
		<hr>
		<br>

		If you check the 'hints' checkbox then you'll get some help:<br>
		<br>

		When you mouse-over a revealed tile, it will show you highlights over all the other tiles in its neighborhood which it detected.<br>
		If this matches the number of flags around it then the highlight will be green, indicating all other unflagged un-revealed tiles are safe to check (presuming your flagged mines are in the right place).<br>
		Otherwise the highlight will be red, indicating that the unchecked neighbors are still potentially unsafe.<br>
		<br>

		When you mouse-over a hidden tile, it will show you highlights over all the revealed tiles which have this tile in their neighborhoods.<br>
		You can then mouse over those revealed tiles and see if any have a complete set of mines flagged.<br>
		<br>

		<hr>
		<br>
		
		If you check the 'QUANTUM GRAVITY MODE' checkbox then every single tile will have a completely random neighborhood.<br>
		You are going to want to play with hints enabled.

		<hr>
		<br>

		Torus mode just means that the neighborhoods of the tiles wraps around the left/right and top/bottom of the board.<br>
