		This is just like original minesweeper but with varying detection neighborhoods.<Br>

		ORIGINAL MINESWEEPER HELP:<br>
		<Br>

		In the original minesweeper, you click tiles to reveal whether they have mines underneath them or not.<br>
		If they do, and you click them, you die, game over.<br>
		If they don't, then they will reveal a number.<br>
		The number will tell you how many mines are surrounding the tile you clicked,
		i.e. the number of mines in the 3x3 neighborhood around the tile.<br>
		You could think of the tile as having a mine detector that was a 3x3 neighborhood around the tile.<br>
		<br>

		You are also able to flag tiles as potential mines using the right-click button.<Br>
		<Br>

		You win the game when you reveal all the tiles that don't have mines under them.<br>
		<br>

		<br>

		SWINEKEEPER:<br>
		<br>

		In this version the tiles will have arbitrary neighborhoods.<br>
		You can choose on the right column under 'neighborhoods' which possible neighborhoods to allow.<br>
		If you uncheck all of them except the '3x3' option then you will get original minesweeper.<br>
		<br>
		
		<hr>
		<br>

		Now when you open a tile, it will tell you first the number of mines next to it, and next the letter indicating what kind of neighborhood it is using to detect the mines.<br>
		The 'neighborhoods' legend in the upper-right will show you what each of the letters mean.<br>
		<br>
		
		<hr>
		<br>

		If you check the 'hints' checkbox then you'll get some help:<br>
		<br>

		When you mouse-over a revealed tile, it will show you highlights over all the other tiles in its neighborhood which it detected.<br>
		If this matches the number of flags around it then the highlight will be green, indicating all other unflagged un-revealed tiles are safe to check (presuming your flagged mines are in the right place).<br>
		Otherwise the highlight will be red, indicating that the unchecked neighbors are still potentially unsafe.<br>
		<br>

		When you mouse-over a hidden tile, it will show you highlights over all the revealed tiles which have this tile in their neighborhoods.<br>
		You can then mouse over those revealed tiles and see if any have a complete set of mines flagged.<br>
		<br>

		<hr>
		<br>
		
		If you check the 'QUANTUM GRAVITY MODE' checkbox then every single tile will have a completely random neighborhood.<br>
		You are going to want to play with hints enabled.

		<hr>
		<br>

		Torus mode just means that the neighborhoods of the tiles wraps around the left/right and top/bottom of the board.<br>
